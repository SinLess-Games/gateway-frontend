                    Midian is a world that is full of adventure and danger.
                    Humans, Dwarves, half-elves, and the occasional Halfling,
                    Elf, and Half-Ogre can be found int the cities. Elves are
                    rare in human cities, commonly kept as slaves, or as pets.
                    The cities are full of life and danger, full of people just
                    trying to get by. You can think of these cites as a mix
                    between steampunk and victorian era architecture and
                    technologies.

                <h3 className="TaintedSubTitle">Who created Midian</h3>
                <p className="TaintedContent">
                    Midian was created for D&D 3.5 by Tyler Clark in 2008. The
                    world has slowly been expanded and developed over the years,
                    as campaign after Campaign has been played in this world. As
                    One of the players, Timothy Pierce Wanted to make this world
                    into a video game, and got permission to. SinLess Games Will
                    work closely With Tyler to make sure that the world of
                    Midian is as true to the original as possible. With Even
                    expansions to the various campaigns that have been played in
                    the homebrew world, with many more to come.

                <h3 className="TaintedSubTitle">What is the game about</h3>
                <p className="TaintedContent">
                    I was prophesized that a generation preceded by the Long
                    Night would would be forsaken by the God Ankhou, God of the
                    afterlife and death. This generation; the players; would
                    face many hardships being sent back time and time again by
                    Ankhou who does not value their lives. Tainted Kingdoms has
                    two main quest lines, one for the good guys, and one for the
                    bad guys. The good guys quest line is just trying to make
                    Midian a better place day by day, while the Evil characters,
                    are more self-serving than anything be it lust for power, or
                    petty thievery. Everyone No matter their alignment want the
                    same thing just to make it one to the next day.
